# Video Classification Using ANN Architectures

## Project Overview
This project focuses on video classification using a range of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architectures combined with advanced video preprocessing techniques. Our goal is to explore the potential of deep learning in accurately classifying video sequences into predefined categories.

## Project Idea
Video classification is a challenging task due to the complexity of video data, involving spatial and temporal features. In this project, we apply various ANN architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and 3D CNNs, to capture both frame-level and sequence-level information.

## Algorithms and Architectures
We plan to experiment with the following architectures:
- **3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs)**: To capture spatial and temporal dynamics.
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: For handling temporal dependencies in video frames.
- **Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM)**: Combining convolutional operations with LSTMs to improve spatial-temporal feature extraction.
- **Temporal Segment Networks (TSN)**: To model long-term temporal structures across videos.

## Advanced Video Preprocessing Techniques
To enhance the performance of our models, we will use the following preprocessing techniques:
- **Optical Flow Extraction**: For capturing motion dynamics between frames.
- **Frame Sampling**: To reduce redundancy in video sequences.
- **Data Augmentation**: Such as rotation, flipping, and brightness adjustments for better generalization.

## Datasets
We will be using the following datasets to evaluate our models:
- **UCF-101**: An action recognition dataset with 101 action classes and over 13,000 videos.
- **Kinetics-400**: A large-scale video dataset containing 400 action classes.

## Tools and Libraries
The tools and frameworks we plan to use include:
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the neural network models.
- **OpenCV**: For video preprocessing tasks.
- **FFmpeg**: For handling video conversions and preprocessing.
- **PyTorch**: As an alternative for model development and experimentation.

## Project Setup

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

> **Note**: This project requires Python version **3.11>=**.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:IVproger/CV_VideoClassification_project.git
   cd CV_VideoClassification_project
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -Ur requirements.txt
   ```
